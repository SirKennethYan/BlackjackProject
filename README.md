# Lessons Learned
This project was both a challenge and a learning opportunity for me. I deepen my understanding of classes and to become familiar with a new type of class, Enums. One of the key differences between this project and previous projects was that I had a clear game plan in mind before starting to code. This helped me avoid the haphazard approach that cost me time in the past. Furthermore, I took the time to play the Blackjack Game and created a story that I wanted to turn into code. This made it easier for me to direct my coding efforts and saved me time compared to my previous experience.
