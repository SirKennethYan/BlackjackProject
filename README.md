# Lessons Learned
This project helped me familiarize myself more with classes and a new class call Enums. This project gave me the most headaches out of all projects so far. My code was Red more often than not and it took the entire weekend to get where I am. I'm very sleepy. One thing that I did this time compared to the last is I had a gameplan in mind. My last project I hapharzarly just went in and started coding and cost me alot of time. I played the Blackjack Game for queit awhile until I was able to type out a story that I wanted to turn into code. As far as typing the code out and what direction I wanted to head, it was alot easier than last time.
